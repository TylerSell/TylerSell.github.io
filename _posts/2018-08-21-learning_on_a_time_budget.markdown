Hey all.  I'm back with another installment of my learning journey.  If you are reading this maybe you are in the same situation as me.  You have a job.  You have obligations that take up your time, and on top of all of this you are trying to take what little free time you have to learn something new that prepares you for a fun and exciting new career path.  This is my story of how it is going so far and how I'm using/making time to continue my learning path to something new.

To recap from my last post about who I am and why I chose to take this step in my life I am going to remind you that I have two little ones at home.  Emma, 6, and Harper, 5 months, take up most of my free time as kids tend to do.  Besides their attention I also currently work a full time job at 40-50 hours per week.  Suffice to say when it's not my job or the kids my time is very limited.  I also would love to keep some symblence of a personal life with my better half.  I do say better half as Alyson is so amazing.  She continues to love me even though my attention for her is severely limited with everything going on.  She stays there by my side through it all and is the best partner anyone could ask for.

At this point just paint the picture even more I am going to walk you through a typical day.  My day starts like most of you with kids in school.  It starts between 6:30 and 7:00 am (earlier if the baby decides she wants to be up).  I have to get the 6 year old up.  Help her get dressed and have breakfast.  Then get her lunch and backpack packed up and outside in time for the bus which shows up a little after 8:00 am.  Then it's time for me to get ready for work and try to be out the door by 9:30 am to make it to work on time.  I generally work from 10am - 7pm.  By the time I get home it is usually close to 8 pm.  At that point it is time to wind down, eat dinner, and spend an hour with the kids before bed.  Then I like to take an hour to get something done around the house or spend time with Alyson.  So around 10:30 pm is when I get a chance to start some lessons and do some coding.  I try to get 3 hours in each night so I can be in bed by 2 am.  Then the whole thing starts over the next day.  I keep my sanity by knowing that it is only temporary and is leading to something new and better.

But wait Tyler, what about your days off?  Wouldn't you have more time on those days?  On the surface yes you would technically be correct.  There are more free hours on paper.  But my days off are the days that I get to spend time, actual time, with the family.  I also have my honey-do list to work on.  Grocery shopping, mowing the lawn, the things that make the house run.  It's not all on my to do but it's also not fair for me to ask Alyson to do it all.  Plus to keep my sanity I need a day to relax and maybe catch up on some much needed ZZZ's.

All this being said my life now and for the forseeable future is a little hectic.  But with everything being as it is I still find time to get some coding done and progress through this program.  And learning so far is awesome.  I can feel my understanding and skills grow each day.  It may be less than somebody who can devote a full day to this but I am making lemonaide with the fruits I have.  I am progressing and WILL finish this program.  It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when.

Till the next time we speak, keep going and don't get carpal tunnel!!
